# gatsby-transformer-excel

Parses Excel files into JSON arrays.

## Install

`npm install --save gatsby-transformer-excel`

Note: You generally will use this plugin together with the [`gatsby-source-filesystem`](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/) plugin. `gatsby-source-filesystem` reads in the files then this plugin _transforms_ the files into data you can query.

## How to use

If you put your Excel files in `./src/data`:

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `data`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/data/`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-excel`,
  ],
}
```

This plugin allows you to pass any available options used by the underlying library's function. [Click here](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-xlsx#json) to view the full list of options and the default values.

You can see an example project at [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-excel](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-excel).

## Parsing algorithm

The parsing is powered by the [SheetJS / js-xlsx](https://git.io/xlsx) library.
Each row of each worksheet is converted into a node whose keys are determined by
the first row and whose type is determined by the name of the worksheet.

So if your project has a `letters.xlsx` with two worksheets:

```text
------ Sheet1 ------
/|    A    |   B   |
-+---------+-------+
1| letter  | value |
-+---------+-------+
2|    a    |   97  |
-+---------+-------+
3|    b    |   98  |

------ Sheet2 ------
/|    A    |   B   |
-+---------+-------+
1| letter  | value |
-+---------+-------+
2|    A    |   65  |
-+---------+-------+
3|    B    |   66  |
```

the following nodes would be created:

```json
[
  { "letter": "a", "value": 97, "type": "LettersXlsxSheet1" },
  { "letter": "b", "value": 98, "type": "LettersXlsxSheet1" },
  { "letter": "A", "value": 65, "type": "LettersXlsxSheet2" },
  { "letter": "B", "value": 66, "type": "LettersXlsxSheet2" }
]
```

## How to query

Using the same `letters.xlsx` example from above, you'd be able to query your letters like:

```graphql
{
  allLettersXlsxSheet1 {
    edges {
      node {
        letter
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which would return:

```javascript
{
  allLettersXlsxSheet1: {
    edges: [
      {
        node: {
          letter: 'a'
          value: 97
        }
      },
      {
        node: {
          letter: 'b'
          value: 98
        }
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Default Values

If your spreadsheet contains column headers with only blank cells, the default behavior is to exclude this column in the graphql output as per the [documentation](https://docs.sheetjs.com/#json)

> If `defval` is not specified, `null` and `undefined` values are skipped normally. If specified, all `null` and `undefined` points will be filled with `defval`.

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-excel`,
      options: {
        defval: "",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

This will make sure that any blank cells are assigned the `defval` value.

### Field Type Conflicts

If your columns have different data types, e.g. numbers and strings graphql will omit these values and provide you with a field type conflicts warning during build.
To solve this, you can set the rawOutput option of the plugin to false. This will convert all values to strings.

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-excel`,
      options: {
        raw: false,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

This will make sure that all field types are converted to strings.

_NOTE 1_: A previous version of this library used the attribute name `rawOutput`. This name still works, but is an alias for the correct attribute `raw`. If both attributes are specified, the value for `raw` takes precedence.
